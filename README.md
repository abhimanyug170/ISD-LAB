### Description

“Working remotely” and “Work from home” are some of the buzzwords in the present day. These might have made working easier but at the same time made the task of team management much difficult. Managing diverse teams and monitoring the progress of each team member has presented various new challenges. Hence, we’ve come up with a solution for the same.

Our task manager is a smart-contract for managing team-related activities. Through this contract, you can manage a task’s lifecycle by assigning appropriate states like “Active”, “Under-Review”, “Completed”, or “Expired”. Each task will contain a reward and a deadline in the starting phase of its lifecycle. Deadline, if not followed may incur some penalty which will be deducted from the reward points specified initially. A task once submitted, will go through a review process by the reviewer specified while creating the task. If the task is approved by the reviewer, the assignee gets his share of the reward, otherwise, the work gets rejected. 

In this way, we offer a hassle-free experience for managing team-related tasks in a decentralized and secure way.
